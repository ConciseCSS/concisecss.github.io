This is the repository that contains the source code for concisecss.com. 
If you plan to make a change please do it in the corresponding source file located in the `src` directory and before commiting changes make sure the changed files are being compiled (if you are editing Pug or Concise CSS code).

## Building the Website

If you wish to make changes to the source files please make sure you have NodeJS installed before beginning. If you are ready to start hacking, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the project in the terminal:

```
cd path/to/concisecss.github.com
```

2. Install the development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. You can now run the following command to start a development server:

```
npm start
```

You can view the website on http://localhost:8080 and if you have [livereload](http://livereload.com/extensions/) installed in your browsers, you will be able to see changes inmediately (well, with a little delay).

Every time you make a change to a .pug or .scss file, it gets automatically recompiled. So you don’t have to make any build process before submitting changes to the repository. After making your changes—if you had the development server active—you can send them to this repository using a Pull Request.

      <p>There are many other front-end development frameworks in the world today. There are some that power as much as a 1% of the entire Internet. A lot of these frameworks are supported by hundreds of contributors and have been downloaded millions of times. In fact, without the mere existence of these frameworks, I would have never had the idea to create my own.</p>

      <p>So why another framework? As a professional web designer and developer for more than six years I have grown more and more discontent with framework offerings for people specializing in front-end development. Why? Because often times these frameworks come bloated out of the box. They have more than 5,000 lines of CSS, and equally as much JavaScript. They attempt to solve every single problem for every single situation that a front-end developer could be put in.</p>

      <p>And you know what?</p>

      <p class="h2">It's just.<br />Too.<br />Much.</p>

      <p>Not every single project I'm working on needs modal pop-ups or tabbed content. Hell, not even a percentage of my projects need half of what these frameworks are offering. Often times, all I need is clean, semantic markup that makes sense and is easy to learn. A simple grid system, some clean typography, and maybe a couple of navigation and list styles option. Don't even get me started on customizing those style sheets.</p>

      <p class="h2">So why don't I give people this option?</p>

      <p>Concise is built so that you have a lot of options handed to you out of the box. It comes built from the ground up to be mobile friendly and includes a simple grid system, beautiful typography, and a few other bells and whistles. However, it is also built super lean, with a little more than 2,500 thousand lines of CSS, and a few hundred lines of JavaScript. Concise is specifically built to be customized, tinkered with, and hacked.</p>

      <p>The whole goal for people using Concise is that they can use the framework to fuel their own creations. The framework comes with very few predefined styles, so overriding styles is never a hassle.</p>

      <p>I want people to not use these bloated front-end frameworks out of necessity. I want there to be an option that is lean, easy-to-use, and easy to learn.</p>

      <p class="h2">Give Concise a try. I think you'll like it.</p>

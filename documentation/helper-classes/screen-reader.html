<h1 class="no-margin">Screen Reader Content</h1>

<hr />

<p>Concise offers a simple way to <a href="show-hide.php">hide content</a>, but careful consideration needs to be taken when deciding <em>how</em> content should be hidden. For example, sometimes content needs to be hidden from users, but visible to people using screen readers.</p>

<p>One common reason for doing this is if you were to use icons on your page without any supporting text. People without a screen reader could see the icons and understand the context of the icon, but people using a screen reader could not. By using the <code>.screen-reader</code> class, content is hidden from anybody viewing the website on a monitor, but can still read by a screen reader.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> for our icon font ensures that our icons are not read by a screen reader. I highly suggest reading <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/bulletproof_icon_fonts.html">the Filament Group's article</a> to learn more about this fallback.</p>

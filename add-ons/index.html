<p>Add-Ons are pieces of code or libraries that have been written by myself or others and are not included with the core Concise package. These include extra JavaScript libraries and effects, as as more extensive CSS styling and effects.</p>

<p>We are always looking for more great, lean add-ons to feature here. If you are interested in submitting an add-on, or just have an idea that you'd like to send our way, feel free to post a message on our <a href="https://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues page</a>.</p>

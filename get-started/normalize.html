<h1 class="no-margin">Normalize</h1>

<hr />

<p>Concise comes packed with Nicolas Gallagher's lovely <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank">Normalize.CSS</a> to help in our cross-browser CSS rendering. Normalize does a wonderful job normalizing CSS elements to create consistency between browsers. <small>(However, Concise is using <a href="https://github.com/keenanpayne/normalize.scss" target="_blank">my own forked version of Normalize</a> that differs in small ways)</small>.</p>

<p>The other popular tool to help in cross-browser CSS rendering is <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" target="_blank">Eric Meyer's Reset.CSS</a>. I chose Normalize over Reset because Normalize actually preserves some useful defaults instead of just unstyling everything. Normalize also has a wider scope than Reset and is much more supported and documented.</p>

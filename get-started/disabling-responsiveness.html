<h1 class="no-margin">Disabling Responsiveness</h1>

<hr />

<p>Not interested in the responsive design that comes with Concise by default? Have no fear, disabling responsiveness can be accomplished with a few easy steps.</p>

<p>First, we need to ensure that the following {% highlight html %}<meta>{% endhighlight %} tags are <em>not</em> present in our website's {% highlight html %}<head>{% endhighlight %} section.</p>

{% highlight css %}
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="True">
<meta name="MobileOptimized" content="320">
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In our custom CSS files, or in {% highlight html %}<style>{% endhighlight %} tags, we need to set a fixed width for our container element <small>(I'm using 960 pixels as my example)</small>:</p>

{% highlight css %}.container { width: 960px !important; }{% endhighlight %}

<p>This overrides the Concise responsive container that is enabled by default. Next, we need to add a single class to our <code><body></code> tag, that will aid in disabling other responsive aspects of the site:</p>

{% highlight css %}<body class="non-responsive">{% endhighlight %}

<p>Just like that, you have a non-responsive website, and thereâ€™s an added bonus. Concise is built so that you can declare any width for your <code>.container</code> class, and the grid columns will adjust automatically. Every single column will have a correct width relative to that of the container.</p>

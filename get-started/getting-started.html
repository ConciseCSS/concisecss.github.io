<p>Getting started with Concise is very simple. First, pick a package to download below. If you are unsure of which package is the right one for you, download the first, titled "<u>Concise.CSS</u>".</p>

<div class="row gutters">
  <div class="column-8">
    <h3>Concise.CSS</h3>

    <p>Compiled files (minified and non-minified) as JavaScript files.</p>

    <a class="btn btn--borderBlue btn-small btn--full" href="https://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css/releases/download/{{ site.version }}/concise-{{ site.download-version }}-dist.zip">Download</a>
  </div>

  <div class="column-8">
    <h3>SASS</h3>

    <p>Compiled files (minified and non-minified), source SASS files and JavaScript files.</p>

    <a class="btn btn--borderBlue btn-small btn--full" href="https://github.com/ConciseCSS/concise.css/archive/{{ site.version }}.zip">Download</a>
  </div>

<h2>What's Included</h2>

<h3>Pre-Compiled Concise</h3>

<p>The Concise directory is pretty simple. Here is what you are looking at for the regular download:</p>

{% highlight css %}/css
  concise.css
  concise.min.css
/js
  concise.js
  concise.min.js{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Concise Source Code</h3>

<p>If you are downloading the SASS package, the folder structure will look like:</p>

<p class="note">All of the files labeled with an underscore are referred to as <em>partials</em>. A partial is a file that does not become compiled on its own, but rather, is included in a master file <small>(in this case, it's <code>concise.scss</code>)</small> to be compiled.</p>

{% highlight css %}
/dist
  /css
    concise.css
    concise.min.css
  /js
    concise.js
    concise.min.js
/js
  close.js

<h2>Including Necessary Files</h2>

<p>To get started with a bare-bones responsive website using Concise, I would recommend structuring your template as such:</p>

{% highlight html %}<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="True">

  <title>Concise Template</title>

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/concise.min.css" />
</head>

<body>

  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="js/concise.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Right there, you have a basic template with all included files, proper meta tags for responsiveness, and you're ready to start coding.</p>

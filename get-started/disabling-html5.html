<h1 class="no-margin">Disabling HTML5</h1>

<hr />

<p>Concise, as with almost all other front-end frameworks, has adopted the use of HTML5 for presentation and markup. When coupled with <a href="https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/" target="_blank">HTML5shiv</a> and other polyfills, HTML5 elements will look presentable in old browsers.</p>

<p>However, if you would like to switch back to HTML4 or XHTML, Concise offers a simple way to accomplish just that.</p>

<p>First, we will want to remove the <code><!doctype html></code> from the top of our <code><head></code> section, and replace it with one of the alternatives:</p>

<strong>HTML 4.01 Strict:</strong>
{% highlight css %}<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">{% endhighlight %}

<strong>HTML 4.01 Transitional:</strong>
{% highlight css %}<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">{% endhighlight %}

<strong>XHTML 1.0 Strict:</strong>
{% highlight css %}<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">{% endhighlight %}

<strong>XHTML 1.0 Transitional:</strong>
{% highlight css %}<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">{% endhighlight %}

<strong>XHTML 1.1:</strong>
{% highlight css %}<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">{% endhighlight %}

<p>Other than that, all of the presentation elements present in Concise have been applied to Concise, meaning that <code><header></header></code> is not necessary when creating a header. Instead, you can simply have <code><div class="header"><div></code> in proper pre-HTML5 fashion.</p>
